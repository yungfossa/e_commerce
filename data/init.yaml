# This YAML file contains initial setup data for the ShopSphere e-commerce application.
# It defines categories, admin accounts, seller accounts, and customer accounts.

# Categories:
# A list of product categories available in the store.

# Admins:
# Administrative user accounts with full access to the system.
# Each admin has an email, name, and password.

# Sellers:
# Seller accounts that can list and manage products.
# Each seller has an email, name, and password.

# Customers:
# Customer accounts for users who can browse and purchase products.
# Each customer has an email, first name (name), last name (surname), and password.

# Security Note:
# The passwords in this file are placeholders and should be changed
# before deploying to a production environment. In a real-world scenario,
# you would typically not store passwords in plain text like this.

# Usage:
# This file is likely used to populate the database with initial data
# when setting up the application for the first time or resetting it to
# a known state for testing purposes.
